## Usage
There are 8 supported charts with many configuration options.
Almost all configuration available in base MPAndroidChart library are available through this wrapper.
More details on available configuration can be found on their [wiki](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki).

Example of how charts are used and how to apply configuration can be found in example.



## Convention

Android and IOS have different convention:

1. color's alpha in android is 0-255, in ios is 0-1
2. percent in android is 0-100, in ios is 0-1
3. animation.duration in MpAndroidChart is milliseconds, in Charts is seconds.
4. their enum case name is always different, for example XAxisPosition, in MpAndroidChart is BOTH_SIDED, in Charts is bothSided.

**Here we use android Convention**

**Always use processColor to set color**



## Data Format

- Complete Form


		data : {
			...
			dataSets: [
				{
					values: [
						{x: 5, y: 90},
						{x: 10, y: 130},
						{x: 50, y: 2000, marker: "eat more"},
						{x: 80, y: 9000, marker: "eat less"}
					]
				},
				...
			]
		}

marker is optional,  if x is omitted, index will be used.

- Simplified Form

	    data: {
			...
	        dataSets: [
	        	{
	          		values: [5, 40, 77, 81, 43]
	          	},
	          	....
	        ]
	    }

index will used as x.
